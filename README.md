This is a simplified version of the question filter but does not require the Atto button

In this version the user places special codes within text anywhere in Moodle which 
can then be replaced by a link to a question number in the database.  

The code is of the form {QUESTION:linktext|xxx} where xxx is the question id number.  You
can find this number by looking at the questions in your question bank. 

This question is then previewed with a simplified version of preview.php
